# Interference classification for subGHz technologies
## Summary
We provide a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based classifer for classification of three subGHz technologies including Sigfox, LoRA and IEEE802.15.4 (subGHz). Among the technologies, we consider eight signal classes which include 1 class of sigfox transmitting randomly on the 400 sigfox channels, 6 classes of LoRA with spreading factors (SFs) 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12, and 1 class of IEEE 802.15.4 g.
